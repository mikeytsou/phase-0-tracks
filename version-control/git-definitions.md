# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

    Version control is a system that keeps track of changes to files so that and those changes can be recalled later if needed. It's useful because you can collaborate with others.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

    A branch is a copy of of your project to work on which can eventually be merged to the master. Branches are useful because they allow you to make changes to you project without affecting the master project.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

    A commit permanently stores changes from the staging area in the repository. A good commit message is written in present tense, brief, and explains what was changed.

* What is a merge conflict?

    A merge conflict is when two branches contain file changes that cannot be merged. Typically when those changes occur on the same file.

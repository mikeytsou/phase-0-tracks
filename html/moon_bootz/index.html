  <p>1. <b>Block-level elements</b> start on a new line and uses the entire space of its parent element(container) in a web page and disrupt the natural flow of text. Most of the common HTML elements are block-level elements including headings, paragraphs, divs, unordered and ordered lists, and tables.</p>

  <p>2. The way block-level elements are used is entirely semantic. Meaning that there are a ton of html elements that do the same thing but are used differently based on how readable you want your html to be. The div and section elements achieve the same thing except div is more vague and section is more specific.</p>
  <!-- Section is semantic (and newer). Div can be used similarly but doesn't have the implicit meaning (see Jennifer Nordell's explanation). Some courses in treehouse use sections and some stick with divs for sections. There are also a couple other tags that are similar (<main>, <article>, <aside>, <footer>, <header>, or <nav>). Section is a large scale idea of what content on the page is. Div can be used for smaller things, such as a container for presentation, or where there is no semantic idea to be communicated. You can always look at these elements at mozilla's developer network. But having your HTML be semantic is ideal. (to be honest, i had the same question, and a lot of older code does make things murkier) -->

  <p>3. <b>Inline elements</b> display inline with text and can start anywhere in a line without disrupting the flow of the text. Some inline elements include links, images, bold, and span.</p>

  <p>4. Inline elements may only contain data and other inline elements. Thus, inline elements are usually nested inside block-level elements because block-level elements may contain inline elements and other block-level elements.</p>

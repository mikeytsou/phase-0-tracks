<!--
* HTML5 semantic tags are to used to reinforce the meaning of information rather than just define its presentation. The most useful semantic tags are <header>, <main>, <section>, and <footer> just to name a few.

* In HTML, elements are displayed in a browser entirely from top to bottom. This means that the first element in the body will be executed prior to any other element within the body and descend from there.

* I learned that Sublime is very customizable with packages and snippets. I think I'll definitely create more snippets as I learn more about them.

* The most difficult concept of this challenge were the different semantic HTML5 tags and I think I can improve by practicing and using them more.

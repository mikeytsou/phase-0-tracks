3. There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.
sqlite> SELECT users.first_name, users.last_name, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comments
   ...> FROM reviews
   ...> JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.id
   ...> JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id;
first_name  last_name   name         stars       comments           
----------  ----------  -----------  ----------  -------------------

4. How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business? 
sqlite> SELECT users.first_name, users.last_name, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comments
   ...> FROM reviews
   ...> JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.id
   ...> JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id
   ...> WHERE name = "Chipotle";
first_name  last_name   name        stars       comments                   
----------  ----------  ----------  ----------  ---------------------------
Alan        Lee         Chipotle    2           Expensive and not very good
Lena        Smith       Chipotle    2           Bad service                
Mia         Yang        Chipotle    5           Great service
